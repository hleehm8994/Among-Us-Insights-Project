# Among_Us_Insights_Project
"Among Us" is an online multiplayer social deduction game available on a variety of platforms, including Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PlayStation.

The main goals of this project is to identify common sequences of actions during gameplay and analyze preferred game modes & player behaviors to increase the overall player experience and make it more playable.

To achieve this, I first collected and created diverse data sources within "Among Us" game logs, player interactions, and feedback utilizing Python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, as well as visualization based libraries including Matplotlib & Seaborn. Recommendations and insights are shared at the end of the notebook.
